# Synthetic-35S-promoters-for-GB
This perl script generates semi-random synthetic core 35S promoter that are domesticated for cloning in the GoldenBraid System.
The generated sequences maintain the same number nucleotide rations than the original 35S core promoter but avoids the generation
of potential GC and GNC metylation sequences. In addtion the sequence and postion of the TATA box sequence is also preserved.
